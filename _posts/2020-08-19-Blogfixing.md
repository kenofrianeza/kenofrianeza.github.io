Hello again! I finally got around to fixing some stuff on my blog. It took me a month of lazy searching to find out why the CSS wasn't rendering properly, and it turns out I was linking to 'style.css' when it should be 'styles.css'. Silly me!
Hopefully I get myself to post regularly now, though the main problem is going to be what I'm going to post about. Bye for now!
