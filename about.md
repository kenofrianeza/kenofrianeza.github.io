This is a Jekyll-made blog by Keno Roberto S. Frianeza, currently a student at the University of the Philippines Diliman.

I created this blog to try to wean myself from using social media and be a part of the IndieWeb movement. I've always wanted to start a blog (using many failed WordPress ones in the past), but I never was consistent in posting and eventually forget about it. Now, I've made my own barebones blog template and am ready to start again!
